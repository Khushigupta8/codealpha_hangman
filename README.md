This is a simple *text-based Hangman game* developed as part of my mini project.
# Project Description
The Hangman game allows a player to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. The player has a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends
# Key Features:
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list
- Accepts user input from the console
- Displays correct guesses and remaining chances
- Ends with a win/lose message

# Concepts Used:
- Python random module
- while loops and if-else logic
- String and list operations
- Console input/output

# How to Run:
1. Make sure you have Python installed (3.x).
2. Clone the repository or download the hangman.py file.
3. Run the file using the terminal:

```bash
python hangman.py
